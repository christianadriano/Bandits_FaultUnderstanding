##Choosing a prior##

#TODO
If we have a few data points from the rewards, we can use them to choose a prior that is
better than the uninformative prior.
Look at https://a-little-book-of-r-for-bayesian-statistics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/bayesianstats.html

When we know nothing, we can assume uninformative prior, a beta(1,1)
